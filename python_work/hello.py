# The lower() method is particularly useful for storing data. 
# Many times you won’t want to trust the capitalization that your 
# users provide, so you’ll convert strings to lowercase before storing them. 
# Then when you want to display the information, you’ll use the case that makes
#  the most sense for each string.
