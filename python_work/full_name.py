# To insert a variableâ€™s value into a string, place the letter f
# immediately before the opening quotation mark. Put braces around
# the name or names of any variable you want to use inside the string.
# Python will replace each variable with its value when the string is displayed.
# These strings are called f-strings. The f is for format, because Python
# formats the string by replacing the name of any variable in braces with its value.
